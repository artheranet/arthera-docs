The **Shock Arthera** validator program acts as the essential electric shocks that infuse life into the system, guaranteeing seamless operations and establishing a foundation of strength, resilience, and reliability. Its pivotal role is to propel the system towards the Mainnet, ensuring smooth functionality and setting the stage for a flourishing and enduring ecosystem.

It's a permissionless network dedicated to validators that were selected as part of the registration process.

Program Objectives

- Simulating a working ecosystem
- Stress-testing the network
- Selecting trusted validators

  This network will be reset frequently and it will have periods of instability as
  we run various test scenarios.

## Running a validator node

### 1. Get a machine that meets the following requirements:

- CPU: 4 cores / 8 threads, 2.6GHz, or faster
- RAM: 8GB or more
- Disk: 500GB of SSD storage or more
- Network: 1GBps, Public IP

### 2. Install Docker

See the [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## 3. Pull the latest Arthera node image

```bash
docker pull arthera/arthera-node:1.2.0-devnet.rc2
```

## 4. Create a folder to hold your Arthera node data

```bash
mkdir $HOME/arthera
```

## 5. Create a wallet for your validator

```bash
docker run -it -v $HOME/arthera:/data arthera/arthera-node:1.2.0-devnet.rc2 account new
```

Enter a password for the new account and you will get an output similar to the one below:

```
Your new key was generated

Public address of the key:   0x0bEdA7aAB9cFAa963443e27e30a8F04A79f099C3
Path of the secret key file: /data/keystore/UTC--2023-07-18T21-48-46.572871703Z--088dc563b8184107010c947c4b94bbc856992985

- You can share your public address with anyone. Others need it to interact with you.
- You must NEVER share the secret key with anyone! The key controls access to your funds!
- You must BACKUP your key file! Without the key, it's impossible to access account funds!
- You must REMEMBER your password! Without the password, it's impossible to decrypt the key!
```

<Alert severity="error">
  1. Copy the generated secret key file from{" "}
  <strong>$HOME/arthera/keystore/UTC-****</strong> to your workstation. You will
  need it later on. <br />
  2. Remember the password
</Alert>

## 6. Create the validator identity

```bash
docker run -it -v $HOME/arthera:/data arthera/arthera-node:1.2.0-devnet.rc2  validator new
```

Enter a password for the validator account and you will get an output similar to the one below:

```
Your new key was generated

Public key: 		0xc004c1edab0ed2b77a316c81114177bb071bbc94ec2674a3ccb42c59fe539dd301c1868b919a7cd208d1e8798af141cf2fc41994c35cf4dfc3dd7df74f431f086022
Path of the secret key file: /data/keystore/validator/c004c1edab0ed2b77a316c81114177bb071bbc94ec2674a3ccb42c59fe539dd301c1868b919a7cd208d1e8798af141cf2fc41994c35cf4dfc3dd7df74f431f086022

- You can share your public key with anyone. Others need it to validate messages from you.
- You must NEVER share the secret key with anyone! The key controls access to your validator!
- You must BACKUP your key file! Without the key, it's impossible to operate the validator!
- You must REMEMBER your password! Without the password, it's impossible to decrypt the key!
```

<Alert severity="error">
  1. Copy the validator's <strong>Public key</strong> displayed above <br />
  2. Remember the password
</Alert>

## 7. Register your validator

This step requires that you submit the validator's wallet address created in step [5. Create a wallet for your validator](#5-create-a-wallet-for-your-validator)
and the Public Key created in [6. Create the validator identity](#6-create-the-validator-identity) to Arthera, so we can delegate the required
coins to your validator (the minimum stake of 100,000 AA).

## 8. View your validator in the Arthera Wallet

While you wait for us to delegate the required coins to your validator, you can register your account it in the [Arthera wallet](https://wallet-test.arthera.net).

1. Configure MetaMask to connect to the Arthera Devnet (see [Network details](#network-details))
2. Import you wallet private key created in step [5. Create a wallet for your validator](#5-create-a-wallet-for-your-validator) into Metamask
3. Go to [`https://wallet-dev.arthera.net`](https://wallet-dev.arthera.net)
4. Login with Metamask and select the imported account
5. Under the **Account** menu you should see your new validator (after we delegate the required coins to it)

<Alert severity="warning">
  The next steps require that your validator is shown in the Arthera Wallet. If
  you don't see it, wait for us to delegate the required coins to it and try
  again.
</Alert>

## 9. Create a password file

Run the command below and replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with the password entered in step [6. Create the validator identity](#6-create-the-validator-identity)

```bash
echo "YOUR_PASSWORD" > $HOME/arthera/password
```

## 10. Generate your node key

Run the command below to generate your unique node key:

```bash
docker run -it -v $HOME/arthera:/data arthera/arthera-node:1.2.0-devnet.rc2 p2p genkey /data/node.key
```

Check to see if the key was generated successfully by running:

```bash
docker run -it -v $HOME/arthera:/data arthera/arthera-node:1.2.0-devnet.rc2 p2p enodeurl /data/node.key
```

You should see an output similar to the one below:

```
enode://f2927b8b1bc1b05997acf60f713cda3c776300cdac52b80d8dbfb2b434ef0e7283f8d3ca891d832bab3927b03c52593e575d48d9916804af5bf66a75b5b1288a@127.0.0.1:6534
```

The output above is your node's `enode` URL. You will need it later on for identifying your node in the Metrics dashboard.

## 11. Download the latest Devnet genesis file

Run the command below to download the `devnet3.g` genesis file:

```bash
curl -o $HOME/arthera/genesis.g https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/release.arthera.net/devnet.g
```

## 12. Test your node

Replace the following variables and run the command below to start your validator:

- `YOUR_PUBLIC_IP` with your actual Public IP address.
- `ID_FROM_STEP_8` with the Validator ID obtained from step [8. View your validator in the Arthera Wallet](#8-view-your-validator-in-the-arthera-wallet)
- `VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_STEP_6` with the **Public key** of your validator from step [6. Create the validator identity](#6-create-the-validator-identity)

```bash
docker pull arthera/arthera-node:1.2.0-devnet.rc2
docker run --name arthera-validator -p 6535:6060 -v $HOME/arthera:/data arthera/arthera-node:1.2.0-devnet.rc2 \
  --nodekey /data/node.key \
  --devnet \
  --nat extip:YOUR_PUBLIC_IP \
  --validator.id ID_FROM_STEP_8 \
  --validator.pubkey "VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_STEP_6"
```

Check the output to have the following info:

```bash

```

If you get messages like `New event` and `New block` it means your node is syncing and working properly.

You can now stop the node with `Ctrl+C`, clean the output folder with `rm -rf $HOME/arthera/arthera-node $HOME/arthera/chaindata`
and remove the docker container with `docker container rm arthera-validator` and move to the next step.

## 13. Run your node

Replace the following variables and run the command below to start your validator:

- `YOUR_PUBLIC_IP` with your actual Public IP address.
- `ID_FROM_STEP_8` with the Validator ID obtained from step [8. View your validator in the Arthera Wallet](#8-view-your-validator-in-the-arthera-wallet)
- `VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_STEP_6` with the **Public key** of your validator from step [6. Create the validator identity](#6-create-the-validator-identity)

```bash
docker container rm arthera-validator # remove any existing containers just to be sure
docker pull arthera/arthera-node:1.2.0-devnet.rc2
docker run --name arthera-validator -d --restart unless-stopped -p 6535:6060 -v $HOME/arthera:/data arthera/arthera-node:1.2.0-devnet.rc2 \
  --nodekey /data/node.key \
  --devnet \
  --verbosity 5 \
  --nat extip:YOUR_PUBLIC_IP \
  --validator.id ID_FROM_STEP_8 \
  --validator.pubkey "VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_STEP_6"
```

Check the node was started with `docker ps`:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                   COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS        PORTS                                                                                                              NAMES

```

and check the logs of the container with `docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>`. You should see the following output:

```bash
INFO [08-12|05:57:39.972] New block                                ....

```

## Troubleshooting

#### 1. Node is not syncing

The most common problems are firewalls and incorrectly provided external IP address.

#### 2. Cleanup node data and restart validator

1. Stop the doocker container with `docker container stop arthera-validator`
2. Remove the database with `rm -rf $HOME/arthera/arthera-node $HOME/arthera/chaindata`
3. Start the docker container with `docker container start arthera-validator`

#### 3. Database is corrupted

description: Hardware and Software requirements you need to become a validator on Arthera
---

Our Mainnet is still in development, but until then the Arthera testnet is the best place to get started running a validator, or test out new validator configurations.

## Prerequisites
Participating in the Arthera testnet requires testnet AA coins that can be obtained from the [faucet](https://faucet.arthera.net), or directly from the [Arthera wallet](https://wallet-test.arthera.net).
If you need any help getting started, please don't hesitate to contact us on our Telegram channel. We'll guide you through the process and help you solve any issues.

## Hardware & Network requirements
You can either run a node on your own hardware or use a cloud provider. We would recommend going with one of the big cloud providers like Amazon AWS.

- CPU: 4 cores / 8 threads, 2.6GHz, or faster
- RAM: 8GB or more
- Disk: 500GB of SSD storage or more
- Network: 1GBps

On AWS EC2 we recommend the m5.xlarge instance with 4 vCPUs (3.1 GHz) and at least 1 TB of Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) storage (or equivalent).

**Network requirements:**
- Your node must have static, external IP addresses. Ensure the machine used is not behind a residential NAT to avoid NAT traversal issues. A cloud-hosted machine works best.
- Ensure that IP port 6534 is not blocked for Internet TCP and UDP inbound and outbound traffic.  This port is used to communicate with other nodes in the network.

## Software requirements
The following 64-bit Operating Systems are supported:
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Fedora 37+
- CentOS 9

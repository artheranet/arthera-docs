The [Arthera Wallet](https://wallet-test.arthera.net) is the official wallet for Arthera. Besides performing basic tasks like transfers and viewing your account activity, it allows users to manage all Arthera-specific features like _staking_, _validators_ and _subscriptions_.

## Main page

The main page of the wallet is where you can see your address, AA balance, tokens and collectibles (NFTs), recent activity and manage subscriptions.

## Subscriptions

The Arthera Wallet is the only supported way right now to purchase and manage your Arthera subscription.

### Buying a subscription

In the subscriptions widget you can purchase a new subscription or manage you existing subscription. There are two types of subscriptions:

- [EOA Plan](/learn/about-arthera/pricing-models#eoa-subscriptions)
- [Contract Plan](/learn/about-arthera/pricing-models#contract-subscriptions)

<img src="/img/wallet-buy-sub.png" />

Regular users can buy an **EOA Plan**, while dApps need to buy a **Contract Plan**. For more information about the differences between the two types of subscriptions, please refer to [Subscription Plans](/learn/about-arthera/pricing-models#subscription-plans).

Each subscription plan has a number of **gas units** included and optionally a [cap](/learn/about-arthera/pricing-models#caps).

Click **Subscribe** to purchase a subscription.

To buy a **Contract Plan**, you need to be logged in as the _Subscription Owner_ of the contract for which you're buying the subscription.

### Manage the subscription

Once you've purchased a subscription, you can view it's details:

<img src="/img/wallet-manage-sub.png" />

- **Balance**: remaining gas units
- **Start date**: when the subscription was purchased
- **End date**: when the subscription will expire
- **Usage cap**: usage cap enforced by the purchased subscription

You can **Renew** or **Terminate** your subscription anytime. **Renewing** the subscription will top up its Balance and End date.
The subscription can be **terminated** anytime, deleting the subscription from your account and you will be transitioned to the [Pay per use model](/learn/about-arthera/pricing-models#pay-per-use) immediately.

### Stake your AA

Click the **Stake my tokens** button to delegate your AA to an existing validator. The first step is to choose a validator to delegate your coins to:

<img src="/img/wallet-select-validator.png" />

Click the **Select** button next to your preferred validator. On the next page, you will see information about the selected validator:

<div className="text-center mb-1">
  <img src="/img/wallet-validator-info.png" />
</div>

- **Validator fee**: the fee the validator will take from your staking rewards
- **Total amount staked**: the total amount of AA delegated to this validator

Click the **Stake with validator** to move to the next page where you will enter the amount of AA you want to delegate:

<div className="text-center mb-1">
  <img src="/img/wallet-stake-amount.png" />
</div>

Enter your desired amount and click the **Submit stake** button. A popup will display to confirm your action. Click **Confirm** to finish the process and delegate your coins. If the transaction is successful, a success message will be displayed:

<div className="text-center mb-1">
  <img src="/img/wallet-staking-success.png" />
</div>

### Unstake your AA

To unstake your coins from a validator, click the validator address on the Staking page:

<div className="text-center mb-1">
  <img src="/img/wallet-unstake-select.png" />
</div>

This will take you to the validator page, where you can unstake your coins. Click the **Unstake** button to continue.

<div className="text-center mb-1">
  <img src="/img/wallet-unstake-info.png" />
</div>

Enter the amount you want to unstake and click the **Unstake** button:

<div className="text-center mb-1">
  <img src="/img/wallet-unstake-amount.png" />
</div>

A popup will display to confirm your action. Click **Confirm** to finish the unstaking process. If the transaction is successful, a success message will be displayed:

<div className="text-center mb-1">
  <img src="/img/wallet-unstake-success.png" />
</div>

<Alert severity="warning">
  <strong>
    The avoid bad practices and malicious actors, unstaking will be performed
    within a 48h window. This means your unstaked coins will not be immediately
    available for withdrawal.
  </strong>
</Alert>
<br />

### Withdrawing staked AA

After enough time has passed since your unstake request (48h), you can withdraw the funds to your wallet. Select your validator from the _Staking_ page and you will see your active Unstake requests:

<div className="text-center mb-1">
  <img src="/img/wallet-unstake-requests.png" />
</div>

Click the **Withdraw** button next to your desired unstake request to withdraw the funds to your wallet.

### Managing rewards

As time goes by, your staked coins will generate rewards. You can view how much AA you earned with a validator by selecting the validator on the **Staking** page.
The **Pending rewards** section displays the amount of AA available for withdrawal or restaking.

<div className="text-center mb-1">
  <img src="/img/wallet-unstake-info.png" />
</div>

Rewards can be **Restaked** or **Withdrawed**:

- **Restaking** will add all pending rewards to your existing stake, increasing your delegation with the validator. The validator needs to be active to restake your rewards with it.
- **Withdrawing** will transfer all pending rewards in your wallet.

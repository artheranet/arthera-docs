Enkrypt has Arthera **natively integrated**. Simply toggle the Arthera Testnet in the list of networks!

## Use Enkrypt

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Open Enkrypt:**
   Launch the Enkrypt extension in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Safari, Opera or Edge). If you haven't installed Enkrypt yet, you can download it from the official [Enkrypt website](https://www.enkrypt.com/?mtm_campaign=Arthera%20Official%20Wallets).

2. **Log in to your wallet:**
   If you're not logged in already, enter your password and log in to your Enkrypt wallet.

3. **Toggle Arthera Testnet On**:

   3.1. **Access the network menu:**
   In the Enkrypt extension window, click on "Manage networks".

   3.2. **Enable Testnets:** Click on the Settings button on the top right, then toggle "Show testnets" on.

   3.3. **Find Arthera:** In the same window, scroll down until you see Arthera. Toggle it on and you're set!

4. **Connect to Arthera:** Once the network is added, it will be available in the network menu on the left. Click on Arthera to connect to it.

Now your Enkrypt wallet is connected to Arthera, and you can [interact with smart contracts and dApps on Arthera using Enkrypt](https://blog.enkrypt.com/interact-with-arthera-using-enkrypt/).
Remember that each network has its own set of tokens, so your balances may be different across networks.

## Add Enkrypt to your dApp

Enkrypt provides a [wagmi compatible adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@enkryptcom/connector-wagmi) that can be used within your existing wagmi dapps and along side other wallets.

```ts
import { EnkryptConnector } from "@enkryptcom/connector-wagmi";
import {
  createClient,
  defaultChains,
} from 'wagmi'

const client = createClient({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors: [
    new EnkryptConnector({ chains: defaultChains })
});
```

You can read more about connecting Enkrypt to your dApp in [Enkrypt docs](https://myetherwallet.gitbook.io/enkrypt-documentation/add-enkrypt-to-dapps#evm-dapps).

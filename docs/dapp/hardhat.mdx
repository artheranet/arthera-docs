description: Learn how to configure HardHat for Arthera
---

[**Hardhat**](https://hardhat.org/) is a popular development framework for Solidity smart contracts.
To work with a local Arthera node or with the Arthera TestNet, HardHat needs to know how to connect to the respective network.
Add the following snippet in the `networks` section of the `hardhat.config.js` file. (if the `networks` section does
not exist, you can add it)

```json
...
networks: {
  ...
  arthera-local: {
    url: 'http://localhost:18545',
    chainId: 10244,
    accounts: [
      "163f5f0f9a621d72fedd85ffca3d08d131ab4e812181e0d30ffd1c885d20aac7"
    ]
  },
  arthera-testnet: {
    url: 'https://rpc-test.arthera.net',
    chainId: 10243,
    accounts: []
  }
}
```

Now you can run your HardHat scripts with `npx hardhat run scripts/<YOUR_SCRIPT> --network arthera-testnet`

title: From other EVMs
---
Arthera is a Layer 1 protocol and blockchain platform, and the Arthera Network is separate from the Ethereum network.
While the Arthera blockchain node is implemented on top of go-ethereum (or geth), it has several significant differences,
the most notable one being a leaderless proof-of-stake DAG-based asynchronous BFT consensus mechanism.

In terms of programmability, Arthera is similar to Ethereum. Both networks run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
to support smart contract functionality. This means that all programming languages, developer tooling and standards
that target the EVM are relevant to Arthera as well. Developers building on Arthera can write smart contracts in Solidity,
use Truffle or Hardhat for smart contract management and take advantage of smart contract standards that have already
been developed for Ethereum.

## Differences

The EVM in Arthera works the same way as in Ethereum and Polygon with the following exceptions:

- 10% of unspent gas gets spent as a disincentive to militate against excessive transaction gas limits
- Transactions in blocks aren't necessarily sorted by gas price. Even though transactions in each event and in the
txpool are sorted by gas price, events are sorted by their topological ordering in the DAG. A new block includes
transactions from multiple confirmed events in that topological order.
- The Arthera protocol uses an asynchronous BFT Proof-of-Stake for consensus. This allows blocks to be created in 2 seconds,
as compared to ~12+ seconds on Ethereum. In addition, all blocks are finalized immediately, so there is no need to wait
for more than 1 block confirmation to ensure that a transaction won't be reverted.
- Retrieval of pending blocks is not supported, because Arthera does not have this concept.


### Solidity differences:
The following Solidity global variables behave differently:
- `block.difficulty` is always 0
- `block.gaslimit` is always 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF (infinite)

### API differences:
#### Pending blocks
Retrieval of pending blocks is not supported, because Arthera does not have this concept.

#### Block Header fields
- `nonce` is always 0
- `mixHash` is always 0
- `sha3Uncles` is always 0
- `mixHash` is always 0
- `miner` field is an undefined address
- `difficulty` is always 0
- `extraData` is always empty
- `gasLimit` is always 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF (infinite)
- `receiptsRoot` is always 0
- `timestampNano` is a new field and returns the block's consensus time in UnixNano

#### Unavailable namespaces
- `shh`
- `db`
- `bzz`

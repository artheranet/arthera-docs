import {Alert} from "@mui/material";

Arthera has a number of system contracts that perform various protocol-level tasks. The choice to decouple some
functionality form the main blockchain node to system contract is related to upgradeability.
All System Contracts are upgradeble through a governance process, so if a vote is cast through governance
to change the price of subscription plans or staking rewards, a new version of the respective contracts will be deployed
without having validators upgrade their software or restart their node.

This contract is responsible for keeping track of subscription plans and subscriptions. A subscription is an ERC721
transferable NFT. Each time an account subscribes to a plan, 1 subscription NFT is minted to the subscriber account.
If a user terminates his subscription, the NFT is burned.

### createPlan()
Creates a new subscription plan with an optional usage cap.

**Method parameters:**
- `uint256 duration` duration in days
- `uint256 units` number of gas units
- `uint256 usdPrice` price in USD cents
- `CapFrequency capFrequency` the type of cap: 0=None, 1=Hourly, 2=Daily
- `uint256 capUnits` number of gas units allowed in the cap window
- `bool dapp` if the plan is for DApps

**Emits**
- `event PlanCreated(uint256 planId, uint256 duration, uint256 units, uint256 price, CapFrequency capFrequency, uint256 capUnits, bool dapp)`

### updatePlan()
Updates a plan with new data. It does not update existing active subscriptions, which will keep running based on the old plan values.
The updated values will be taken into account when a subscription is created or renewed.

**Method parameters:**
- `uint256 planId` id of the plan
- `uint256 duration` duration in days
- `uint256 units` number of gas units
- `uint256 usdPrice` price in USD cents
- `CapFrequency capFrequency` the type of cap: 0=None, 1=Hourly, 2=Daily
- `uint256 capUnits` number of gas units allowed in the cap window

**Emits**
- `event PlanUpdated(uint256 planId, uint256 duration, uint256 units, uint256 price, CapFrequency capFrequency, uint256 capUnits)`

### newEOASubscription()
Create a new subscription for an EOA account. The account must not have a previously created subscription.

**Method parameters:**
- `msg.sender` subscription owner (must be an EOA account)
- `uint256 planId` id of the plan to subscribe to

**Emits**
- `event NewSubscription(uint256 id, uint256 planId, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime, uint256 balance)`

### newContractSubscription()
Create a new subscription for an Contract account. The account must not have a previously created subscription.
A Contract subscription must have an EOA owner that can manage the subscription and must inherit
from `@arthera/subscription/ISubscriptionOwner` and `@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol` and
add the following imports and methods to its code:

```solidity
import "@arthera/subscription/ISubscriptionOwner.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol";

/// ... contract code ....

function getSubscriptionOwner() external view returns (address) {
    return address_of_subscription_owner;
}

function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
    public
    view
    override(ERC165)
    returns (bool)
    {
        return interfaceId == type(ISubscriptionOwner).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
```


**Method parameters:**
- `msg.sender` subscription owner
- `address _contract` address of the contract account
- `uint256 planId` id of the plan to subscribe to

**Emits**
- `event NewSubscription(uint256 id, uint256 planId, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime, uint256 balance)`

### renewSubscription()
Renews a subscription and resets all caps. The subscription's balance will be topped up with the number of units in the plan,
and the end date will be extended with the plan's duration, starting from the current block's timestamp.

**Method parameters:**
- `msg.sender` subscription owner

**Emits**
- `event RenewSubscription(uint256 id, uint256 planId, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime, uint256 balance)`

### terminateSubscription()
Terminates a subscription immediately and burns the NFT. No refunds are made.

**Method parameters:**
- `msg.sender` subscription owner

**Emits**
- `event TerminateSubscription(uint256 id)`

### getCapRemaining()
**Returns** `uint256` - gas units available in the current cap window

**Method parameters:**
- `address subscriber` the subscriber to query

### getCapWindow()
**Returns** `uint256` - the end time of the current cap window in unix epoch seconds

**Method parameters:**
- `address subscriber` the subscriber to query

### getBalance()
**Returns** `uint256` - gas units left in the subscription

**Method parameters:**
- `address subscriber` the subscriber to query

### getStartTime()
**Returns** `uint256` - start date of the subscription in unix epoch seconds

**Method parameters:**
- `address subscriber` the subscriber to query

### getEndTime()
**Returns** `uint256` - start date of the subscription in unix epoch seconds

**Method parameters:**
- `address subscriber` the subscriber to query

### hasActiveSubscription()
**Returns** `uint256` - if the subscriber has an active subscription

### hasSubscription()
**Returns** `uint256` - if the subscriber has a subscription (active or inactive)

**Method parameters:**
- `address subscriber` the subscriber to query

### getSubscriptionData()
**Returns** `Subscription` - subscription data

```solidity
struct Subscription {
    uint256 id;
    uint256 planId;
    // remaining gas unit balance
    uint256 balance;
    // when the subscription was started
    uint256 startTime;
    // when the subscription will end
    uint256 endTime;
    // when the subscription was last used (debit/credit)
    uint256 lastCapReset;
    // accumulate usage for the plan's capFrequency
    uint256 periodUsage;
}
```

**Method parameters:**
- `address subscriber` the subscriber to query

### getSubscriptionTokenId()
**Returns** `uint256` - gets the ERC721 token id of the subscription or 2^256-1 if none

**Method parameters:**
- `address subscriber` the subscriber to query

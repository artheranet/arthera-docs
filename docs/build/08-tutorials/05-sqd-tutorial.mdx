# SQD Quickstart

This is a 5-10 minutes quickstart on how to build an indexer using Squid SDK.

### What You Will Learn:

- How to fetch all transactions from the [mint address](https://explorer.arthera.net/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000?tab=txs)
- Decode it
- Save it to a local Postgres database
- Start a GraphQL server with a rich API to query the transactions

### What You Need Before Starting (Prerequisites):

- (On Windows) [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- Node.js v18+
- Git
- Docker (for running Postgres)

## Step 1 - Install Squid CLI

Install Squid CLI:

```bash
pnpm i -g @subsquid/cli
```

Squid CLI is a command line tool for for creating and managing the indexers, both locally and in [SQD Cloud](https://subsquid.io/subsquid-cloud).

## Step 2 - Create the Indexer Project (Squid)

Create the indexer project (squid) from an example repo using Squid CLI:

```bash!
sqd init arthera-squid -t https://github.com/bertux/arthera-squid && cd arthera-squid
```

The example is a starter template of a squid indexer for EVM networks (slightly modified to fit Arthera).

## Step 3 - Explore the ./src Folder

Inspect the `./src` folder:

```bash!
src/
├── abi
├── main.ts
├── processor.ts
└── model
    ├── generated
    │   ├── mint.model.ts
    │   ├── index.ts
    │   └── marshal.ts
    └── index.ts
```

- `src/abi` serves as a [utility module](https://docs.subsquid.io/sdk/resources/tools/typegen/generation/) created from the JSON ABI of the contracts you want to interact with. One module will be generated for each ABI file, and it will include constants useful for filtering and functions for decoding EVM events and functions defined in the ABI. **We are not working with ABI in this tutorial.**
- `src/model` contains TypeORM model classes autogenerated from `schema.graphql`. Squids use them to populate Postgres.

`processor.ts` is the main executable. In this example, it also contains all the data retrieval configuration.

---

Made minor changes to the official EVM template to get real-time data about Arthera transactions from the zero address:

1. Declare a variable for the mint address `const ARTHERA_MINT_ADDRESS = '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'`
2. Change `.setGateway` to https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/arthera-mainnet
3. Provide an RPC endpoint to get real-time data and store it in `arthera-squid/.env`. E.g. `RPC_ETH_HTTP`= https://rpc.arthera.net
4. Adjust `.setFields` to replace `from: true` by `to: true`
5. Adjust `.addTransaction` to use our constant `ARTHERA_MINT_ADDRESS`

Optional changes:

- `rateLimit` (requests per second, default is no limit)
- `setFinalityConfirmation` (sets the number of blocks after which the processor will consider the consensus data final)
- `setBlockRange` (limits the range of blocks to be processed)

```ts!
const ARTHERA_MINT_ADDRESS = '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'

export const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()
    // Lookup archive by the network name in Subsquid registry
    // See https://docs.subsquid.io/evm-indexing/supported-networks/
    .setGateway('https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/arthera-mainnet')
    // Chain RPC endpoint is required for
    //  - indexing unfinalized blocks https://docs.subsquid.io/basics/unfinalized-blocks/
    //  - querying the contract state https://docs.subsquid.io/evm-indexing/query-state/
    .setRpcEndpoint({
        // Set the URL via .env for local runs or via secrets when deploying to Subsquid Cloud
        // https://docs.subsquid.io/deploy-squid/env-variables/
        url: assertNotNull(process.env.RPC_ETH_HTTP, 'No RPC endpoint supplied'),
        // More RPC connection options at https://docs.subsquid.io/evm-indexing/configuration/initialization/#set-data-source
        rateLimit: 10
    })
    .setFinalityConfirmation(75)
    .setFields({
        transaction: {
            to: true,
            value: true,
            hash: true,
        },
    })
    .setBlockRange({
        from: 0,
    })
    .addTransaction({
        from: [ARTHERA_MINT_ADDRESS],
    })
```

The `main.ts` file is about data processing and storage (no changes needed here):

```ts!
processor.run(new TypeormDatabase({supportHotBlocks: true}), async (ctx) => {
    const mints: Mint[] = []
    for (let c of ctx.blocks) {
        for (let tx of c.transactions) {
            // decode and normalize the tx data
            mints.push(
                new Mint({
                    id: tx.id,
                    block: c.header.height,
                    address: tx.to,
                    value: tx.value,
                    txHash: tx.hash,
                })
            )
        }
    }
    // apply vectorized transformations and aggregations
    const minted = mints.length
    const startBlock = ctx.blocks.at(0)?.header.height
    const endBlock = ctx.blocks.at(-1)?.header.height
    ctx.log.info(`Minted a total of ${minted} from ${startBlock} to ${endBlock}`)
    // upsert batches of entities with batch-optimized ctx.store.save
    await ctx.store.upsert(mints)
})
```

## Step 4 - Install Dependencies and Build the Project

Install the dependencies and build.

```bash!
npm ci
npm run build
```

## Step 5 - Initialize Local Postgres Database

The processor is a background process that continously fetches the data, decodes it and stores it in a local Postgres. All the logic is defined in `main.ts` and is fully customizable.

To run the processor, we first start a local Postgres where the decoded data is persisted (the template comes with a Docker compose file):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Step 6 - Apply Database Migrations

Processor will connect to Postgres using the connection parameters from `.env`.

Apply database migrations with:

```bash
npx squid-typeorm-migration apply
```

![Example](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk2VbXwYC.png)

## Step 7 - Start the Processor

Then start the processor with:

```bash
node -r dotenv/config lib/main.js
```

The indexer is now running.

![Example](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJzfWXDYC.png)

## Step 8 - Launch the GraphQL Playground

Start the GraphQL API serving the mint transaction data from Postgres:

```bash
npx squid-graphql-server
```

The server comes with a GraphQL playground available at [`localhost:4350/graphql`](http://localhost:4350/graphql) in your browser.

Try the query below to get the last 10 transactions:

```
query MyQuery {
  mints(limit: 10, orderBy: id_ASC) {
    txHash
    address
    block
  }
}
```

title: Configure the SMP
---

The Arthera SMP ([Subcription Management Platform](../../smp/intro)) is a service that allows you to configure and manage the subscriptions you want to offer to your users.

You can go ahead and create an account: **[https://smp.arthera.net](https://smp.arthera.net)**

## Requirements

### Payment gateway setup

_Payments in crypto will be supported in a near future thanks to our partner [Rampnalysis](https://www.rampnalysis.com/)_

:::

As of now, the SMP **only supports Stripe** as a payment gateway. So to test the SMP, you want to setup a Stripe account:

- [Sign up or log in to your Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login)
- Give it your business info
- Click on [Developers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/developers) (top-right)
- Switch on the Test mode (top-right)
- Click on the [API keys tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
- You're ready to copy-paste the "Publishable key" and the "Secret key"

## Configure your subscription

The SMP is currently in beta so there's a 'happy path' to follow if you want to test it successfully.

### Steps to follow

1. Complete your business profile
2. Select a payment gateway
3. Create a catalog
4. Create one or several products (no space, no hyphen in the name field)
5. Create one or several plans (no space, no hyphen in the name field)
6. Publish your catalog
7. Edit your email templates
8. Edit your invoice template
9. Get your checkout link (if you click on 'Generate new link', it will deactivate the previous one)

### Integration

You can now paste the checkout link in your app: your users will be redirected to the payment page. Once they're done, they will be redirected to "Success URL" you indicated in the Checkout page (in the SMP).

### Test

Please note that when you test the checkout process, you need to connect to a wallet that is different from the `subscription owner` wallet.

You can use the following VISA card account (there are other test credit cards numbers available [here](https://stripe.com/docs/testing?testing-method=card-numbers#visa)):

- `4242424242424242`

Then fill out the checkout form with any future date for the expiration, any CVC number, and any name. you will be redirected to the success page.

## On-chain subscriptions (optional)

The SMP allows you to manage the subscriptions of your on-chain app users.

To activate this feature, you need to add a few lines of code in your Solidity contract. Please follow [this tutorial](./use-subscriptions) (also available as a **[dev.to post](https://dev.to/julienbrg/how-to-add-arthera-subscriptions-to-your-solidity-contracts-43do)**).

Then in the SMP, you want to:

- Go to the `On-Chain` section in the left menu
- Connect your MetaMask wallet with the `subscription owner` wallet address (typically **the wallet that deployed the Solidity contract**)
- Paste the **address of your Solidity contract**

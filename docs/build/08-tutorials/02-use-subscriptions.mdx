A few steps are needed to enable subscriptions for your contract.

### Step 1

Create an account that will manage the subscription for the contract [using Arthera Wallet UI](https://wallet-test-v2.arthera.net), we call it the **subscription owner**. The subscription owner account can whitelist its users so they can interact with the app without paying any gas fees.

<Alert severity="info">
  Once you purchase a subscription for your contract, the{" "}
  <strong>Subscription Owner will receive an ERC721 NFT</strong> that uniquely
  identifies the subscription.
</Alert>
<br />

### Step 2

Create the `ISubscriptionOwner.sol` file:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ISubscriptionOwner {
    function getSubscriptionOwner() external view returns (address);
}
```

### Step 3

Import `ISubscriptionOwner.sol` and `@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol`:

```solidity
import "./ISubscriptionOwner.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol";
```

### Step 4

Your contract must inherit from `ISubscriptionOwner` and `ERC165`:

```solidity
contract YourContract is ISubscriptionOwner, ERC165 {
    /// ... contract code ....
}
```

### Step 5

At the end of your contract code, you must add the following methods:

```solidity
/// ... contract code ....

function getSubscriptionOwner() external view returns (address) {
    // the owner of the subscription must be an EOA
    // Replace this with the account created in Step 1
    return <ADDRESS_OF_THE_SUBSCRIPTION_OWNER>;
}

function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view override(ERC165) returns (bool) {
    return interfaceId == type(ISubscriptionOwner).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
}
```

The `ISubscriptionOwner` interface allows Arthera to determine the owner of the subscription, which must be an EOA account (it can't be a contract).

If your contract is ownable, your `getSubscriptionOwner` function would look like this:

```solidity
function getSubscriptionOwner() external view returns (address) {
    return owner();
}
```

If your contracts inherits from other contracts, you want to make sure the order of inheritances is correct (the `ERC165` often goes first).

### Step 6

Deploy your contract to Arthera Testnet.

- RPC Endpoint: **`https://rpc-test.arthera.net`**
- Chain ID: **`10243`**

### Step 7

- Go back to the [Arthera Wallet UI](https://wallet-test-v2.arthera.net)
- Connect with your subscription owner wallet
- Click on "Subscribe" (**DApp Plan**)
- Paste your contract address in the field

At this stage, you're ready to whitelist your users so they can interact with your service without paying any gas fees.

In your app interface, you can whitelist users calling the `whitelistAccount` function from the subscription owner wallet:

```js
await subscribers.whitelistAccount(contractAddress, userAddress);
```

THe ABI of the Subscribers contract is [here](https://github.com/w3hc/imnotlate-ui/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx#L56-L1788), the address is:

```
0x000000000000000000000000000000000000aa07
```

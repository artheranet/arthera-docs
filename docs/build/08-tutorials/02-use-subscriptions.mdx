title: Use subscriptions in your contract
---

import { Alert } from "@mui/material";

A few steps are needed to enable subscriptions for your contract.

**Step 1: ** Create an account that will manage the subscription for the contract. This account will act as the **Subscription Owner**, allowing it to make changes to the contract's subscription plan.

<Alert severity="info">
  Once you purchase a subscription for your contract, the{" "}
  <strong>Subscription Owner will receive an ERC721 NFT</strong> that uniquely
  identifies the subscription.
</Alert>
<br />

**Step 2: ** Create the `ISubscriptionOwner.sol` file:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ISubscriptionOwner {
    function getSubscriptionOwner() external view returns (address);
}
```

**Step 3: ** Import `ISubscriptionOwner.sol` and `@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol`:

```solidity
import "./ISubscriptionOwner.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol";
```

**Step 4: ** Have your contract inherit from `ISubscriptionOwner` and `ERC165`:

```solidity
contract YourContract is ISubscriptionOwner, ERC165 {
    /// ... contract code ....
}
```

**Step 5: ** Add the following methods at the end of your contract code:

```solidity
/// ... contract code ....

function getSubscriptionOwner() external view returns (address) {
    // the owner of the subscription must be an EOA
    // Replace this with the account created in Step 1
    return address_of_subscription_owner;
}

function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
    public
    view
    override(ERC165)
    returns (bool)
    {
        return interfaceId == type(ISubscriptionOwner).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
```

The `ISubscriptionOwner` interface allows Arthera to determine the owner of the subscription, which must be an EOA account.

**Step 6: ** Deploy the contract

**Step 7: ** Login to the [Arthera Wallet](https://wallet-test.arthera.net) using the **Subscription Owner** account created in **Step 1** and purchase a dApp subscription for your newly deployed contract

title: Migrate your EVM smart contract
---

import { Alert } from "@mui/material";

In terms of programmability, Arthera is similar to Ethereum. Both networks run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
to support smart contract functionality.

<Alert severity="success">
  <strong>
    All programming languages, developer tooling and standards that target the
    EVM should work on Arthera as well.
  </strong>
</Alert>
<br />

<Alert severity="warning">
  <strong>
    There are some minor differences described in the{" "}
    <a href="/build/differences">EVM & API differences</a> section. Please read
    the section carefully to see if the EVM and API differences have an impact
    on your dApp.

</Alert>
<br />

Because Arthera supports all programming languages, developer tooling and standards that target the EVM, deploying your contracts on Arthera should follow the same process as with other EVMs:

1. Configure your contract tooling and SDKs to target the Arthera testnet:

   - **RPC Endpoint: `https://rpc-test.arthera.net`**
   - **WebSocket Endpoint (Optional): `wss://ws-test.arthera.net`**
   - **Chain ID: `10243`**

2. Create an account using the [Arthera Wallet](https://wallet-test.arthera.net) and get some testnet AA coins from the [Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.arthera.net) or directly from the wallet.

3. Deploy your contract(s)

4. Check the explorer ([Blockscout](https://explorer-test.arthera.net) or [SocialScan](https://arthera-testnet.socialscan.io)) for the deployment transaction to be successful

5. Optionally verify your contract. Go to the explorer ([Blockscout](https://explorer-test.arthera.net) or [SocialScan](https://arthera-testnet.socialscan.io)), search for your contract address and click the `Verify and Publish` button under the `Contract` tab:

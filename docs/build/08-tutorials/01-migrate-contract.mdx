title: Migrate your EVM smart contract
---

import { Alert } from "@mui/material";

In terms of programmability, Arthera is similar to Ethereum. Both networks run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
to support smart contract functionality.

<Alert severity="success">
  <strong>
    All programming languages, developer tooling and standards that target the
    EVM version Paris and earlier should work on Arthera as well.
  </strong>
</Alert>
<br />

<Alert severity="warning">
  <strong>
    There are some minor differences described in the{" "}
    <a href="/build/differences">EVM & API differences</a> section. Please read
    the section carefully to see if the EVM and API differences have an impact
    on your dApp.

Because Arthera supports all programming languages, developer tooling and standards that target the EVM version Paris and earlier, deploying your contracts on Arthera should follow the same process as with other EVMs:

1. Configure your contract tooling and SDKs to target the Arthera Testnet:

   - **RPC Endpoint: `https://rpc-test.arthera.net`**
   - **WebSocket Endpoint (Optional): `wss://ws-test.arthera.net`**
   - **Chain ID: `10243`**

2. Create an account using the [Arthera Wallet](https://wallet-test.arthera.net) and get some testnet subscription from the [Testnet Faucet](https://faucet-test.arthera.net/) or directly from the wallet if you have enough AA tokens to buy a subscription.

3. Deploy your contract(s)

4. Check the explorer ([Blockscout](https://explorer-test.arthera.net)) for the deployment transaction to be successful

5. Optionally verify your contract. Go to the explorer ([Blockscout](https://explorer-test.arthera.net)), search for your contract address and click the `Verify and Publish` button under the `Contract` tab. You can allso verify your contracts programmatically (using Sourcify). [Learn more about contracts verification](/build/developing-sc/contracts-verification)

At this stage, you're ready to deploy to Arthera Mainnet.

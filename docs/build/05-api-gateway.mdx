Arthera provides high-performance GraphQL and REST API gateway for fetching blockchain data. It provides conveninent endpoints for fetching low-level and aggregate information related to accounts, tokens, staking, subscriptions and more.

<Alert severity="info">
  <p>The Mainnet has the following available API Gateway endpoint:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <Link href={"https://apigw.arthera.net"}>
        https://apigw.arthera.net
      </Link>
    </li>
  </ul>
</Alert>
<br />
You can use the <strong>
  <Link href={"https://explorer-test-api.arthera.net/"}>
    Arthera Explorer API
  </Link>
</strong> to interact with API endpoints, build requests, visualize responses,
and learn more about the API Gateway. .

## GraphQL

The GraphQL API describes available entities and attributes with a schema and lets the client decide which parts, elements and services it needs to perform its operation.
The schema is extensively documented, so you should be able to use it intuitively.

The GraphQL API is available under the `/api` endpoint.

### Scalar Values

The API uses additional scalar types beyond the default GraphQL ones to encode big numbers, byte arrays and addresses:

- **Hash** - a 32-byte hexadecimal string prefixed by 0x
- **Address** - a 20-byte hexadecimal string prefixed by 0x representing an Arthera address
- **BigInt** - a hexadecimal string prefixed by 0x representing a Big Integer
- **Long** - a hexadecimal string prefixed by 0x representing a 64-bit unsigned integer
- **Bytes** - a hexadecimal string prefixed by 0x representing byte array. An empty array is represented by '0x'
- **Cursor** - an unspecified string value representing the position in a sequential list of edges. Read more about cursors in the **Pagination** section.

Transaction amounts, account balances, rewards and all amount-related data is encoded in `WEI` as big integers in prefixed hexadecimal format.

In your client application you can use Ethereum's Web3 libraries to help you deal with decoding and validation for most data types defined here.

### Pagination

The API paginates results based on cursors. Each member of a collection has a unique identifier named `cursor`.
When you want to obtain a slice of the collection, you specify the `cursor` value of the collection member and a count of how many records following the one provided you need.
If you do not specify the `cursor`, we assume you mean either the top or the bottom of the collection. The relative anchor is determined by the value of your neighbors `count`.

For example this query provides 15 consecutive block after the one with cursor "0x134b7":

```graphql
query BlocksList {
  blocks(cursor: "0x25c3", count: 5) {
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      first
      last
      hasNext
      hasPrevious
    }
    edges {
      cursor
      block {
        hash
        number
        timestamp
        transactionCount
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To get 10 most recent transactions, you have to skip the `cursor` and send the following query:

```graphql
query TransactionsList {
  transactions(count: 10) {
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      first
      last
      hasNext
      hasPrevious
    }
    edges {
      cursor
      transaction {
        hash
        from
        to
        value
        block {
          timestamp
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each response will contain data structures to help you navigate through the collection:

- `pageInfo`: contains the `first` and `last` cursor of your current slice
- `edges`: contains the data element and a `cursor` which can be used to create a link to the same position in the collection regardless of the absolute distance of the element from the top or bottom.

### Interactive console

You can play around and test GraphQL queries by opening the [**/graphi**](https://apigw.arthera.net/graphi) endpoint on each API gateway.

<img src="/img/graphi.png" />

## REST

Besides the GrapgQL API which covers most needs, the API Gateway provides some useful REST endpoints:

- [**/rest/gas**](https://apigw.arthera.net/rest/gas) returns a JSON structure with current gas price info:

  - _Output_: a JSON object with the following structure:

    - `fastest` - price in gwei
    - `fast` - price in gwei
    - `average` - price in gwei
    - `safeLow` - price in gwei

  - _Example_:

  ```shell
  curl "https://apigw.arthera.net/rest/gas"
  ```

- [**/rest/account**](https://apigw.arthera.net/rest/account?addr=0x3BD2DeC1Dd270d5673eFFd3cC30fD13445e964aD) returns detailed information for the provided address:

  - _Input_:
    - `addr` - 0x-prefixed account address as a URL parameter
  - _Output_: a JSON object with the following structure:

    - `balance` - Big Integer encoded as a 0x-prefixed hexadecimal string representing the account balance in WEI
    - `contract` - contract creation transaction hash if available
    - `type` - the type of address: wallet, contract, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155
    - `lastActivity` - Big Integer encoded as a 0x-prefixed hexadecimal string representing the unix timestamp of the block where the account was last seen
    - `txCount` - Big Integer encoded as a 0x-prefixed hexadecimal string representing the number of transactions sent from the account
    - `erc20Tokens` - array of ERC20 token addresses owned by the account
    - `erc721Tokens` - array of ERC20 tokens addresses owned by the account
    - `erc1155Tokens` - array of ERC20 tokens addresses owned by the account

  - _Example_:
    ```bash
    curl "https://apigw.arthera.net/rest/account?addr=0x3BD2DeC1Dd270d5673eFFd3cC30fD13445e964aD"
    ```

- [**/rest/balanceof**](https://apigw.arthera.net/rest/balanceof) returns the balance of an ERC20, ERC721 or ERC1155 token for the provided address:

  - _Input_:
    - `addr` - 0x-prefixed account address as a URL parameter
    - `token` - 0x-prefixed token contract address as a URL parameter
    - `type` - type of ERC token contract: erc20, erc721, erc1155
    - `tokenId` - (only for type=erc1155) Big Integer encoded as a 0x-prefixed hexadecimal string representing the token id
  - _Output_: a JSON object with the following structure:

    - `balance` - Big Integer encoded as a 0x-prefixed hexadecimal string representing the token balance in WEI

  - _Example_:

  ```bash
  curl "https://apigw.arthera.net/rest/balanceof?type=erc1155&addr=0x3BD2DeC1Dd270d5673eFFd3cC30fD13445e964aD&token=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000Aa07&tokenId=0x1"
  ```

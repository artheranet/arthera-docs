description: How to get your Solidity contracts verified on the explorer?

There are several ways to get your contract verified on Arthera Testnet explorer.

### Manually

The easiest way is probably to first flatten your contracts, and paste the flattened code in the explorer. if you're using Hardhat, you can use the following command (it's built-in):

```bash
npx hardhat flatten
```

Copy your code, then in the explorer ([Blockscout](https://explorer-test.arthera.net) or [SocialScan](https://arthera-testnet.socialscan.io)), search for your contract address, click the `Verify and Publish` button and paste your code there.

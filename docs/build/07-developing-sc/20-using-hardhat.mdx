description: Learn how to configure Hardhat for Arthera
---

[**Hardhat**](https://hardhat.org/) is a popular development framework for Solidity smart contracts.
To work with a local Arthera node or with the Arthera TestNet, HardHat needs to know how to connect to the respective network.
Add the following snippet in the `networks` section of the `hardhat.config.js` file. (if the `networks` section does
not exist, you can add it).

```js
networks: {
  arthera: {
    url: 'https://rpc.arthera.net',
    chainId: 10242,
    accounts: []
  },
  arthera-testnet: {
    url: 'https://rpc-test.arthera.net',
    chainId: 10243,
    accounts: []
  }
}
```

Now you can run your HardHat scripts with `npx hardhat run scripts/<YOUR_SCRIPT> --network arthera-testnet`

You can view a more complete example of a Hardhat config file [here](https://github.com/artheranet/arthera-hardhat-template/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts).

### A Hardhat template

You can clone or fork [this repository](https://github.com/artheranet/arthera-hardhat-template) to see how Arthera can be integrated in a Hardhat project. It's in TypeScript. You can simply click on the 'Use this template' button, and then select 'Create a new repository' or 'Open in a codespace'.

### Contract verification

Arthera Hardhat template includes the Hardhat Deploy plugin. [Learn more abot contracts verification](/build/developing-sc/contracts-verification)

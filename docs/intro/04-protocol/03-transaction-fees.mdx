title: Transaction Fees
---
Each transaction on Artera requires a transaction fee paid to the network in order to prevent spam attacks.
The fee is paid in Arhtera's native token AA.

## Gas
Gas refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations on
the Arthera network. Since each transaction requires computational resources to execute, each transaction
requires a fee. Gas refers to the fee required to execute a transaction on Arthera, regardless of transaction success
or failure.

Gas fees are paid in Arthera's native currency, AA. Gas prices are denoted in gwei, which itself is a denomination
of AA - each gwei is equal to 0.000000001 AA (10-9 AA).

Different types of transactions have different gas limits depending on their complexity; a simple process
like a simple AA funds transfer, costs less in Gas than executing a complicated smart contract transaction.

While the amount of Gas required for any transaction, such as a payment, staking, etc., remains constant, Gas price
is dynamic and rises and falls according to network traffic.

Taking these factors into consideration, the calculation for transaction fees is:

`Transaction fee = price per unit of Gas * amount of Gas used`


### Max gas fee
To execute a transaction on the network, users can specify a maximum limit they are willing to pay for their
transaction to be executed. The max fee must exceed the sum of the base fee and the tip. If the provided max fee exceeds
the actual transaction fee, the sender is refunded the difference between the max fee and the actual computed fee.


## Pay-as-You-Go mode
In this mode users pay standard transaction fees to the network.

## Subscription mode
If an account has an active subscription, the amount of gas units consumed by a transaction will be deducted
from their subscription.
